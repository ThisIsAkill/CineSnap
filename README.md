## Features

- **Frame Extraction**: Extract frames from a video file at specified intervals.
- **Time Interval Extraction**: Extract frames at regular time intervals, e.g., every 10 seconds.
- **Custom Timestamp Extraction**: Extract frames at specific timestamps provided in a file.
- **Pause Before Capture**: Introduce a pause before capturing each frame to improve image quality.
- **Timestamps and Duration**: Generate a text file with frame numbers, video timestamps (in frames), and video durations (in hh:mm:ss format) for each extracted frame

## Prerequisites

Before using CineSnap, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/): A powerful multimedia framework for handling audio, video, and other media files.

## Commands

- **'<video_file>'**: Path to the video file from which frames will be extracted.
- **'-ts <interval>'**: Extract frames at the specified time interval (in seconds). For example, '-ts 10' will extract frames every 10 seconds.
- **'-tsfile <timestamps_file>'**: Extract frames at the timestamps provided in the specified file. The file should contain one timestamp per line, in seconds.

## Usage

1. Clone the CineSnap repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thisisakill/CineSnap.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the CineSnap directory:
   ```bash
   cd CineSnap
   ```
3. Make the shell script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x cinesnap
   ```
4. Run the script with the video file path and the desired extraction interval (in seconds) as arguments:
   ```bash
   ./cinesnap <video_file> [-ts <interval> | -tsfile <timestamps_file>]
   ```
5. The extracted frames will be saved in a directory named after the video file (without the extension) within the CineSnap repository.

## Examples

```bash
#Extract frames every 10 seconds from video.mp4
./cinesnap video.mp4 -ts 10
```

```bash
#Extract frames at the timestamps specified in timestamps.txt
./cinesnap video.mp4 -tsfile timestamps.txt
```
## Output

- Extracted Frames: The frames extracted from the video will be saved as individual images in the same directory as the video file. The images will be named in the format "frame_1.jpg", "frame_2.jpg", and so on.
- Timestamps File: When using the **'-ts'** or **'-tsfile'** options, CineSnap generates a text file named "extracted_frames_timestamps.txt" in the same directory as the video file. This file contains the frame number, video timestamp (in frames), and video duration (in hh:mm:ss format) for each extracted frame.
